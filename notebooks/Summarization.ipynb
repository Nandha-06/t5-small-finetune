Platforms like Facebook, Twitter (now X), Instagram, and TikTok allow users to share thoughts, news, and personal experiences instantly with a global audience. This connectivity has had many benefits, such as enabling social movements, promoting business growth, and allowing real-time information sharing. For instance, movements like #MeToo and Black Lives Matter gained international traction due to the rapid dissemination of information via social media. Businesses use platforms to reach new markets, build brand loyalty, and interact directly with customers.\n",

        "However, the widespread use of social media also brings several challenges. One major concern is the spread of misinformation and fake news, which can influence public opinion and even elections. The viral nature of content can amplify falsehoods quickly, often before fact-checkers can intervene. Moreover, algorithms designed to maximize user engagement may prioritize sensational or polarizing content, leading to echo chambers and increased political and social division.\n",
        "\n",
        "Social media also impacts mental health, especially among younger users. Studies have linked excessive use to anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, as users often compare their lives to idealized portrayals online. Additionally, issues like cyberbullying, online harassment, and data privacy breaches continue to raise concerns. Governments and tech companies are under increasing pressure to implement regulations, improve content moderation, and protect user data.\n",
